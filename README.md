Global Terrorism Analysis using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning to analyze global terrorism data, aiming to identify trends and predictors of terrorist activities. Using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), it involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models. The project uncovers significant patterns and evaluates models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks based on metrics such as accuracy and F1-score. Results include visualizations and insights into terrorism trends. Contributions are welcome.
